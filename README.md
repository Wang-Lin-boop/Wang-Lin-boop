### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Brief Introduction
=====

I'm [**Lin Wang** \(çŽ‹æž—\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a Ph.D. student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai \(ç™½èŠ³\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of life science of North East Agricultural University \(NEAU\) in 2019.    
    
My research interests center around the **rational design of small moleculal drugs and artificial proteins for therapeutic purposes**, with a particular focus on developing the molecular modulators of Protein-Protein Interaction \(PPI\). Additionally, I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular design in order to find new avenues for revolution in drug design methodologies.   

ðŸŒ± Representative Works
=====
* **GeminiMol**: a generic molecular representation model pre-trained on a miniaturized dataset (39,290), which incorporates conformational space profile into molecular representation learning. [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol)    
* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method, that can be applied to discovering novel PPIs, the rational design of molecular glues, and protein vaccines. Using the PPI-Miner, we developed the first potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of **molecular glue** degraders. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\] \[[**Online Database**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320) \| [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]

âš¡ I am currently seeking for a position after my PhD....
