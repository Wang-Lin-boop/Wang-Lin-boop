### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm [**Lin Wang** \(çŽ‹æž—\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a Ph.D. student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai \(ç™½èŠ³\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).    
    
ðŸ˜„ My research interests are focused on **developing artificial intelligence methods for the lead discovery** and applying them to design drugs for the treatment of **cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic illnesses**. I have a particular interest in developing **molecular modulators for protein conformational changes and protein-protein interactions**. I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular representation learning and molecular design to revolutionize drug discovery approaches.   

> ðŸŒ± My Representative Works   

* **GeminiMol**: a generic molecular representation model pre-trained on a miniaturized dataset (39,290), which incorporates conformational space profile into molecular representation learning. [_BioRxiv_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.14.571629) [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol)        
* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method, that can be applied to discovering novel PPIs, the rational design of molecular glues, and protein vaccines. Using the PPI-Miner, we developed the first potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of **molecular glue** degraders. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\] \[[**Online Database**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320) \| [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]

âš¡ **I am expected to graduate in June 2024, and I am seeking job opportunities for after graduation .....**
