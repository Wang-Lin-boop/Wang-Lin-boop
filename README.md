### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm [**Lin Wang** \(çŽ‹æž—\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a postdoc in Institute of Systems Medicine of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=MtBs-kMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).    
    
ðŸ˜„ My research interests are focused on **developing artificial intelligence methods for the lead compound discovery** and applying them to design drugs for the treatment of **cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic illnesses**. I have a particular interest in developing **molecular modulators for protein conformational changes and protein-protein interactions**. I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular representation learning and small molecule design to revolutionize drug discovery approaches.   

> ðŸŒ± My Representative Works   

* **GeminiMol**: a generic molecular representation model pre-trained on a miniaturized dataset (39,290), which incorporates conformational space profile into molecular representation learning. [_Advanced Science_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202403998) [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol)        
* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method, that can be applied to discovering novel PPIs, the rational design of molecular glues, and protein vaccines. Using the PPI-Miner, we developed the first potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of **molecular glue** degraders. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\] \[[Online Database](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320) \| [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]
